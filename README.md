# Google Vertex AI Adapter API

This project provides an adapter API for Google Vertex AI models (like Gemma3), allowing clients to interact with them using OpenAI-compatible frameworks.

If you have applications that use OpenAI models like ChatGPT, you can switch to Google Gemma3 model without changing your code, you just need to point to the adapter API endpoint.

This project include sample codes for both Java and Python.
